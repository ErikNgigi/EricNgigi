# Cloud Resume Projects

Welcome to my Cloud Resume Project page! Here, you'll find a selection of projects that showcase my skills and expertise in cloud computing, including automation, infrastructure as code, containerization, and cloud-native application development. Each project is a testament to my passion for cloud technologies and my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth.

## Project 1: Automated Cloud Infrastructure Setup

**Technologies Used**: AWS, Terraform, GitHub Actions

**Overview**: 
This project demonstrates an automated setup of a multi-tier web application infrastructure on AWS. It includes VPC creation, EC2 instances for web servers, RDS for database services, and S3 for storage. The infrastructure's code is version-controlled and deployed using Terraform, with CI/CD pipelines managed via GitHub Actions.

**Features**:
- Fully automated deployment and tear-down of infrastructure
- Secure configuration with private and public subnets, security groups, and IAM roles
- High availability and scalability configurations

## Project 2: Serverless Application Deployment

**Technologies Used**: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Serverless Framework

**Overview**:
A serverless application that processes and analyzes data in real-time. It utilizes AWS Lambda for compute, API Gateway for RESTful endpoints, and DynamoDB for NoSQL database services. The Serverless Framework aids in the deployment and management of the application.

**Features**:
- Auto-scaling to handle varying loads
- Low-cost operation due to pay-per-use billing
- Quick deployment and rollback capabilities
